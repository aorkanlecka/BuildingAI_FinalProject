# WildMisteryAI
Building AI course project

## Summary
The project's main aim is to develop a mobile app which uses machine learning and image recognition technology to analyse images of animal faeces and tracks found, e.g. in the forest. The user would be able to feed the tool with the collected data, and the tool could generate for him/her information about the species of animal to which the faeces or tracks belong.


## Background

I've always been fascinated by nature, and whenever I'm outdoors – in forests, meadows, or even my own allotment – spotting animal tracks sparks my curiosity. However, identifying these tracks can be quite a challenge.

While there are many field guides available, the reality is that tracks you encounter are rarely as pristine as the pictures in those books. Additionally, general image recognition tools like Google Lens aren't specific enough to provide accurate results for animal tracks.

This is especially frustrating when exploring with my child, who, like most youngsters, is naturally inquisitive about the world around him. Imagine how much fun it would be to turn track identification into a game of "animal detective!"

Unfortunately, current resources don't quite offer the perfect solution. This is where a dedicated tool for identifying animal tracks would be incredibly valuable.


## How is it used?

The tool would be useful for many people, in many situations. Here's how it can benefit different audiences:
* Nature lovers: This tool can make analyzing things in nature much easier than the old way (by hand). Imagine being able to study plants and animals more efficiently!
* Teachers and Parents: Ever wonder how to get kids excited about science? This tool can help! It's a great way to spark curiosity and make learning about nature fun and engaging.
* Young Foresters: Just starting out in forestry? This tool can be a real asset, especially when you're gaining experience. It can provide helpful support in your work.


## Data sources and AI methods


A comprehensive data library would be built from several sources:
* Open-license collections: This would includes data mining forfreely available datasets of photos of animal tracks and faeces already compiled by other organizations.
* Wildlife authorities and organizations: Data would be sourced from wildlife conservation agencies and educational groups known for their expertise.
* Self- and crowdsourced data: Authors and early adopters would contribute their own high-quality track images.


## Challenges

The biggest challenge appears to be the size of the database required to train the model, and the need to restrict ourselves (at least in the initial phase of the project) to selected geographical regions. Collecting a sufficiently large, high quality and diverse database would be a major challenge even with the limitation of animal species recognised. In addition to the number of animals, the condition of the tracks left by them, the environment and lighting also play a huge role when recognising an image element - this introduces another area of challenge that would need to be tackled.
Challenges could also arise when trying to obtain data from external organisations.

## What next?

Firstly, more in-depth research into competitive solutions, the market environment and potential data sources and content partners for the project would be required. The next step would be to find funding for the project and a technical team to work on such a project. Further challenges would already be related to the project work and the challenges generated by it.
